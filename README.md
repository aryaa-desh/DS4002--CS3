# DS4002--CS3

This contains the material for DS 4002 CS3

## Section 1: Software and Platform Selection
We used the Python language for all analysis and it was run on a local enviroment through Anacdonda and the code was wrote in VS code.
For additional software we imported the python packages pandas, numpy, and json.
We used Windows as our platform.

#### Section 3: Instructions for Reproducing Results
1. Navigate to the DATA folder and download the file retail_elec_price.csv
2. Upload data into whatever enviroment you use (e.g. Google Colab or VS Code)
3. After uploading the file, navigate to the SCRIPTS folder and upload the P2_data_preprocessing1.ipynb file to the enviroment as well.
4. With both the script and data uploaded, run the script to do the data pre-processing
5. After running the scripts file, you will then have created a pre-processed file similar to preprocessed_data.csv
6. After this, navigate once again to SCRIPTS folder
7. There you will find the file called P2_EDA2.ipynb, put this into your enviroment and run it
8. Once again navigate to the SCRIPTS folder and upload the P2_modeltesting3.ipynb, run it as well
9. Once again navigate to SCRIPTS and also run P2_analysis4.ipynb in the same enviroment as all previous scripts
10. Navigate to SCRIPTS for the last time and run 2022_2025_graph5.ipynb to create graphs to visualize the data
